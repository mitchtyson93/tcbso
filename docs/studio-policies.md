## Studio Policies

### English Immersion Policy

At The Classical Ballet School of Oslo, we are committed to creating an immersive English-speaking environment that benefits all of our students, regardless of their current level of English proficiency. Our ballet classes are conducted entirely in English to provide a consistent and supportive atmosphere where students can develop their dance skills while naturally acquiring language skills through exposure and practice.

**The Benefits of English Immersion**

- **Enhanced Learning:** By hearing and using English regularly, students absorb the language naturally, just as they would in any immersive environment. This method is proven to be one of the most effective ways to learn a new language.
- **Global Opportunities:** English is a widely spoken language in the world of ballet and performing arts. Familiarity with English terminology and instructions will give students a strong advantage in international settings, auditions, and future training opportunities.
- **Consistency and Inclusion:** By maintaining an all-English environment, we ensure that every student, regardless of their native language, receives the same instruction without the need for translations or adjustments that may disrupt the flow of class.

**Participation and Expectations**

- **No Prior Fluency Required:** Children do not need to be fluent in English to join our classes. Through consistent exposure, they will naturally begin to understand and use the language.
- **Listening and Repeating:** As part of the learning process, students may be asked to repeat certain words or phrases they hear during class. This helps with both language acquisition and the reinforcement of ballet terminology.
- **Supportive Environment:** Experienced in working with students of various language backgrounds we will provide clear demonstrations, gestures, and positive reinforcement to ensure comprehension.

We appreciate your support in maintaining this English-speaking environment and look forward to seeing your child grow both in ballet and language skills.
