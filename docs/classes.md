# Our Ballet Classes

At The Classical Ballet School of Oslo, we offer carefully structured programs designed to meet the developmental needs of young dancers while maintaining high standards of classical ballet training.

## Class Levels

### Creative Movement (Age 4)

This engaging and imaginative class introduces young dancers to the joy of movement while developing essential motor skills, coordination, and musical awareness. Through age appropriate playful exercises, storytelling, and props, students will explore the fundamentals of dance—space, rhythm, energy, and expression—while being gently introduced to classical ballet terminology.

Taught entirely in English, this class not only nurtures a love for ballet but also enhances language development in a natural and immersive way. There will be a mix of music with and without lyrics, allowing students to sing along and develop their listening skills.Each class builds upon the previous and each semester builds upon the previous. Dancers are encouraged to enroll for the entire year for optimal growth and experience. By the end of the year, dancers will be able to follow simple instructions in English and gain independence in their movement, building confidence both in and out of the studio.

To ensure individual attention and optimal learning, class size is limited to 12 students. Must have 5 students minimum to hold the class. Students must be potty trained.

**Class is once per week and are offered on Tuesdays 16:00 - 16:45 or Thursdays from 16:15-17:00.**

### Pre-Ballet (Ages 5-6)

Pre-Ballet is a joyful and structured introduction to ballet, designed to bridge the gap between Creative Movement and formal ballet training. Students will build on their foundational movement skills while being introduced to basic ballet positions, postures, and terminology in an engaging and age-appropriate way. They will also begin to develop spatial awareness, the ability to transition between exercises, and the discipline of a ballet class setting. Dancers will begin to work independently in the center of the room, across the floor and be introduced to the ballet barre.

This class is taught entirely in English, creating an immersive language-learning environment that strengthens listening comprehension and communication skills. At the same time, students will be introduced to fundamental ballet vocabulary in French, developing an early understanding of the language traditionally used in ballet worldwide.

All music used in class will be classical ballet music, helping students develop musicality, rhythm, and an appreciation for the rich tradition of ballet. .Each class builds upon the previous and each semester builds upon the previous. Dancers are encouraged to enroll for the entire year for optimal growth and experience. By the end of the year, dancers will gain confidence, independence, and a deeper understanding of both ballet technique and classroom etiquette.

To ensure individual attention and optimal learning, class size is limited to 16 students. Must have 5 students minimum to hold the class.

**Class is once per week and are offered Tuesdays 16:45-17:30 or Thursdays 17:00-17:45.**

### Level 1 Ballet (Ages 7-8)

Level 1 Ballet marks the beginning of formal ballet training, introducing young dancers to the structure and discipline of a traditional ballet class. Students will attend class twice a week for one hour, focusing on the fundamentals of classical ballet through barre work, center exercises, and across-the-floor movement. This progression builds strength, flexibility, coordination, and musicality while reinforcing proper posture and alignment.

Taught entirely in English, this class also builds upon already established ballet vocabulary in French, deepening their understanding of the art form's rich tradition. All music used in class will be classical ballet music, helping dancers refine their rhythm and musical appreciation. In addition to physical development, students will strengthen their memory, pattern recognition, and ability to follow detailed instructions—skills that extend beyond the studio.

### Level 1 Ballet (Age 9)

To be sure material is communicated at an age appropriate level and age appropriate speed we separate our Level 1 nine year olds from our Level 1 seven and eight year olds. The material will be similar but given at a quicker pace. Depending on the competency of the class the Level 1 nine year olds may advance and be given some level 2 material by the end of the spring semester.
