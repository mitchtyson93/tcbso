# About The Classical Ballet School of Oslo

Welcome to The Classical Ballet School of Oslo, where we combine the timeless art of classical ballet with English language immersion to create a unique educational experience for young dancers.

## Teaching Philosophy

The Classical Ballet School of Oslo aims to create a space where children can develop a solid technical ballet foundation while also gaining valuable language skills. Currently offering classical ballet classes for children ages 4-9 in Oslo, with instruction conducted in English, the emphasis is not only on dance education but also about language exposure—offering children an immersive learning environment that nurtures both artistic and linguistic development. Our classes are relevant for any gender and designed to make sure that students receive the comprehensive development they need.

Classes at The Classical Ballet School of Oslo are designed to fill a niche within the Norwegian dance education landscape. While ballet training in Norway is of a high standard, opportunities for young children to receive classical ballet instruction in English remain limited. Given the increasing internationalization of Norway, bilingual education can be an asset to young learners, especially in a discipline like ballet, where many professional opportunities and terminologies are rooted in the English language. Importantly, The Oslo Classical Ballet School's intention is not to diminish the value of the Norwegian language but rather to provide an additional educational resource that enhances students' skills and broadens their opportunities for future artistic and cultural engagement.

Registering your child at The Classical Ballet School of Oslo is signing up for more than just a ballet class—it is an investment in a young students' artistic and educational development. By fostering an early appreciation for ballet and movement while introducing them to a bilingual learning experience, The Classical Ballet School of Oslo hopes to inspire confidence, discipline, and a lifelong love for the arts.

Jennifer has had the privilege of teaching both national and international students at renowned institutions, including the Hartt School Classical Ballet Community Division, Boston Ballet School, Boston University's Dance Department, and Interlochen Arts Academy. Her students have gone on to perform on Broadway, compete at the Youth America Grand Prix, and dance with regional and national ballet companies.

Jennifer began her training at the Jean Wolfmeyer School of Dance in Wisconsin and continued on scholarship at the Virginia School of the Arts, later graduating from the Alabama School of Fine Arts. Throughout her formative years, she trained at prestigious summer intensives such as Interlochen Center for the Arts, Atlanta Ballet, Milwaukee Ballet, Point Park University, and Hubbard Street Dance Chicago.

After earning her Dance Pedagogy degree from the University of Hartford – Hartt School, Jennifer performed internationally in the South Pacific aboard Holland America Cruise Line. In 2017, she returned to the U.S. to lead the dance department at a private boarding school in Maine, where she developed a new curriculum and introduced contemporary movement to an isolated community. She later earned a Master's degree in Arts Leadership and Cultural Management from Colorado State University.

Jennifer was subsequently invited to join the faculty at Boston Ballet School, where she spent five years teaching students ranging from toddlers to pre-professionals and adult learners. She also worked closely with Boston Ballet company members recovering from injuries and expanded her expertise by teaching adaptive dance for students with disabilities. She was a featured presenter at Boston Ballet's Adaptive Dance Teacher Training in 2021 and 2022, a program that reaches educators worldwide.

Always seeking to deepen her teaching knowledge, Jennifer has completed trainings at Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet and the Polestar Pilates Continuing Education Program, becoming a comprehensively trained Pilates instructor. As a performer, she has danced works by George Balanchine, Antony Tudor, Martha Graham, José Limón, and Isadora Duncan.

Jennifer is thrilled to welcome students to The Classical Ballet School of Oslo. She understands that choosing the right ballet school is an important decision, and with over a decade of teaching experience, she is committed to providing a structured and nurturing environment where students can develop both as dancers and individuals.
